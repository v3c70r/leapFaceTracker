#LeapFaceTracker

LeapFaceTracker is an experiment application to reconstruct faces from leap motion images, [FaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/FaceTracker) is used to solve the correspondence problem.

LeapFaceTracker is at very beta version and crashes (a lot). The code base sucks and needs to be rewritten.

However, it works. Images are fetched from Leap Motion by Leap Motion SDK.
